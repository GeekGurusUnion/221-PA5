# PA5
Practical Assignment 5 Group Project

Github Repo: https://github.com/PA5G5/PA5.git

## 1. How-to
Our web-based application runs on PHP.

We have implemented Google Cloud to store our database. So for viewing our database, please see Section 2 (Database Connection) on how to connect to and view our database.

For PHP, we suggest using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). It is also worth mentioning that we didn't make use of any package manager, so the product should run as is in localhost.

The login details are provided in Section 3 for viewing the website.

Our repository will be set to public for clone & marking purposes on 7 June 11:00. Cloning can be done through https://github.com/PA5G5/PA5.git or `gh repo clone PA5G5/PA5` for the Github CLI.

Should anything not work as expected, we have listed our stack in Section 4.


## 2. Database Connection
Our cloud database runs on Google Cloud. You connect exactly the same way as you would with the other Practical Assignments, the connection details are in the [config.php](https://github.com/PA5G5/PA5/blob/main/util/config.php). You can use it with any canned app such as MySQL Workbench. The only difference is when we start working on the database itself, there is no need to dump & upload the database to Github everytime, so it saves a lot of time. 

If the port is prompted, just use `3306`.

Login:
    Normal login as with 216. User can't visit the website if not logged in, therefore a "redirect" must take place to login.php if the user haven't logged in.
Filters:
    The normal filter is working, but more specific filters is needed. Those that already there should still be implemented (SQL wise, just a function call and an action on function call)
Review:
    Needs to show if the user already rated some wine.
    Also needs a "input box" to rate
Manage Users/Wineries/Wines:
    Fields are already editable, once confirm changes is clicked, the updates/deletions must be reflected into the database.
Database Operations:
    Needs SQL implementation


BASIC XML Request:
    var str = "SELECT * FROM Wine";
    // the boolean is if the result should create a table. It will search for the id="table" and create a table & populate it
    XMLRequest(str, <boolean: should create a table?>)
    .then(<any function>)
    .catch(function(error) {
      console.error(error);
      // Handle the error here
    });

    <any function> should be function something(result) {
        // here you can work with the <result> parameter
    }
